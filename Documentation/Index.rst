:Description:
   Headless allows you to render JSON from TYPO3 content. You can customize output
   by changing types, names and nesting of fields.

   This extension provides the backend part (JSON API) for TYPO3 PWA solution.
   The frontend part exists as JavaScript application
   `nuxt-typo3 <https://github.com/TYPO3-Initiatives/nuxt-typo3>`__
   which consumes the JSON API and renders the content using Nuxt framework of VueJS.
   You can find the frontend documentation `here <https://typo3-headless.github.io/nuxt-typo3/>`__.
